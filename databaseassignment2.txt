DATABASE ASSIGNMENT 2
USING THE SELECT STATEMENT 
PS: could not access the assignment on github but tried to elaborate my understanding od the class. 

1. Utilize the SELECT statement to retrieve data from the Expense Tracker database
SELECT amount='50000', category='rent' FROM expenses;
SELECT amount<='10000', category = 'entertainment' FROM expenses;

2. Apply wildcards% and comparison operators for targeted data retrieval
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE description LIKE '% transport %';
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE description LIKE '% household shopping %';
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE amount <= 20000;
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE amount > 100000;

3. Employ the WHERE clause with logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to filter data effectively
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE description like '% household shopping %' AND amount >=20000;
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE category='school fees' OR category='vacation';
SELECT * FROM expenses WHERE category NOT LIKE '% personal grooming %';

4. Organize retrieved data using the ORDER BY clause
SELECT * FROM expenses ORDER BY category ASC, date DESC;
